<br />
Virus and Threat Protection Updates: Windows Security uses security intelligence, also known as definitions, to identify known threats. These definitions include information about known threats. These definitions are updated automatically, but if you suspect a problem with your system, you should ensure that threat definitions are up-to-date before you run a scan.  <br/>

<h2>Post-Lab lessons learnt</h2>

First ever lab (I have ever shared) DONE. I think learning how to navigate Github, creating a repository as well as learning how to use markdown text was probably the most challenging bit. Windows Anti-virus is definitely a great option to ensure your computer data is safe asssuming its configured properly. Learnt how to update threat definitions and perform a custom scan on a specific folder.
